# Security Cleanup Completed

## Changes Made

âœ… **Environment Variables**: All hardcoded Supabase credentials removed from code
âœ… **.env File**: Deleted from repository and added to .gitignore
âœ… **.env.example**: Created with placeholder values
âœ… **Client Code**: Fixed MediaUploadTab.tsx to use proper Supabase client methods
âœ… **Edge Functions**: Already properly configured to use environment variables
âœ… **README**: Updated with environment setup instructions
âœ… **Test Files**: Verified clean of hardcoded credentials

## Remaining Documentation References

**VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md** contains hardcoded Supabase URLs in documentation examples:
- `curl https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zsquagqhilzjumfjxusk/functions/uploads/logs`
- `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT>" https://zsquagqhilzjumfjxusk.supabase.co/rest/v1/profiles`

These are documentation examples and don't expose secrets in the running application, but should use placeholder values like `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` for template purposes.

ðŸ”’ **SECURE**: Application now only works with proper environment variables
ðŸ”’ **NO HARDCODED SECRETS**: All sensitive values moved to environment configuration
